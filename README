## pdfmark

*2018/01/15:*  `pdfmark` is not working with Java 9. You must use 8 or below. 
=====================================================

Extended test data (in the form of lots of PDFs)
can be inserted as a git submodule. You will need
git access on labs.crossref.org to access the
PDF test data repository. If you do, just perform
this command to put the data into your local
repository:

$ git submodule update --init

=====================================================
To run with Docker

- `docker build -t pdfmark .`
- `docker run -v /tmp:/out pdfmark`

You should find a file named '/tmp/test-pdf_xmp.pdf'

You can see the metadata that has been added by using the `exiftool` like this:


`exiftool -a -G1 /tmp/test-pdf_xmp.pdf`
